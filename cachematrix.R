## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your

#The function makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing a function to
#set the value of the matrix
#get the value of the matrix
#set the value of the inverse
#get the value of the inverse

#The function cacheSolve <- function(x, ...)  is used to compute the inverse of the special "matrix"
#defined with makeCacheMatrix

## Write a short comment describing this function
#define the special "matrix"

    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL

  getsolve <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setsolve = setsolve,

}


## Write a short comment describing this function
# This function computes the inverse of a matrix the first time, 
# then in the next calls it reuses the previous inverse, as long as the data is the same

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
